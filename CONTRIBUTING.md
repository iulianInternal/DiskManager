# Contributing to DiskManager

You can contribute in any form you would like to. However, to make it easier for you and for me, you have to follow some basic stuff.

Reporting a bug
---------------
When reporting a bug, make sure that no one reported the same bug in the issue list (this includes closed issues, unless bug apperantly appears again).  
So, when you start writing a report bug, answer (and include) the following questions:  
* What's problem/issue?
* What do you expect instead?
* How to reproduce the issue?
* What's OS, program version?

Code style
----------
You have to follow the same pattern naming in order to contribute.  
All variables are lower camel case.  
All functions, classes are upper camel case.

Fixing a bug
------------
If you fixed a bug, make sure you specify the number of issue (if issue exists), otherwise describe what was the issue.

Requesting a feature
--------------------
When requesting a feature, make sure that no one requested the same feature in the the issue list.  
When requesting a feature, make sure you don't start develop it until we talk about it. It is needed so you don't waste time to something, that you could do something else in your life. And don't worry if feature will not be implemented by any reasons.
